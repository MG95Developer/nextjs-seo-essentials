Hello Developer,

This is just the STARTER CODE for our project where we fetch data (products) from an external API (https://dummyjson.com/). This gives us the chance to work with dynamic data, coming from the server.

The focus of this project is S.E.O only, but you can rebuild the UI yourself to your own preferences.

Also check the full playslist inside my channel: https://www.youtube.com/@TheJavascriptWay

The goal is to cover all of the S.E.O essentials one short video at the time.

Have fun!
